# Superstore_Simple_Analysis

Hello, everyone. This is my attempt to explores the Superstore sales dataset to find trends and insights related to sales performance, profitability, and behavior. The analysis uses Python with basic pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize key metrics. 

## Key Findings:
Sales Focus: All the sales data we looked at is from the United States.

Top Performers: California and New York lead in both sales and profit. While California brings in a lot more sales, its profit is only slightly higher than New York's.

Trouble Spots: States like Texas and Pennsylvania show strong sales but surprisingly lose money. We should investigate these areas.

City-Level Profit: Philadelphia sells a lot, but it's not profitable. We need to figure out how to make sales there turn a profit.

Customer Impact (Sales): Just 30% of our customers are responsible for 60% of all sales.

Customer Impact (Profit): The same top 30% of customers generate a huge 97% of our profit. It's crucial to manage these key clients well.

Product Categories: "Office Supplies" is our most profitable product group.

Underperforming Products: Even though "Bookcases" and "Tables" sell well, they're costing us money. We need a plan to fix their profitability.

Yearly Trends: Customers tend to buy more towards the end of the year, with a noticeable dip in purchases at the start of each new year.

## Conclusion:
The analysis highlights areas (states, cities, product sub-categories, and customer segments) where the Superstore can focus its marketing, and operation efforts to improve overall sales and profitability.
